  <p>This meetup is active in the summer when the cruise ships are in Vancouver.  We do ship tours between the disembarkation and embarkation process.  The cruise lines provide us with these tours to view their ships and sample their fantastic cuisine.  They typically provide us special future cruise offers while onboard.
Boarding the ship for the tours requires passage through port security and all participants must be cleared in advance with ID information (driver's license or passport).  To register, you must follow the instructions closely to be placed on the ship's manifest.</p>
  <p>Sign up to Cruise Lover's here: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cruise-Lovers-Meetup/">Cruise Lover's Meetup</a></p>
  <p>Happy sailings,</p>
